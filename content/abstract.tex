One approach to defending against malicious Android applications has been to
analyze them to detect potential information leaks.  This paper describes a new
static taint analysis for Android that combines and augments the FlowDroid and
Epicc analyses to precisely track both inter-component and intra-component data
flow in a set of Android applications.
The analysis takes place in two phases: given a set of applications, we first
determine the data flows enabled individually by each application, and the
conditions under which these are possible; we then build on these results to
enumerate the potentially dangerous data flows enabled by the set of
applications as a whole.  This paper describes our analysis method,
implementation, and experimental results.
